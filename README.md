## Usage
1. Run the main.py file
2. Add a password to the keychain with the add_password() function
3. Retrieve a password from the keychain with the get_password() function

## Note
- The security of this method is based on the security of the system, so it is important to make sure that the system is properly secured and that the code is not accessible to unauthorized users.
- This method is not considered to be the most secure way of storing password and you should consider other alternatives like using Hashed and salted passwords and using a password manager.
